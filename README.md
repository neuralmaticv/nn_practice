# ðŸ§   Neural networks practice

This repository mostly serves as a learning exercise for me to better understand neural networks and PyTorch's inner workings. Most of the credit goes to [@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) and it's [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero course](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero).

### Content:
* Backpropagation and training of neural network
